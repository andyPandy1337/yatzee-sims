# yatzee-sims
Simulating Yahtzee games, trying to develop heuristic for how to play the game in a better way.

# Approach

1. Set up overall game structure for a game that plays itself. Implement a "random" logic for the player for simplicity.
2. Add simulation layer to be able to play many games over many players.
3. Implement exciting player strategies.
